## Readme file contents

- The name of the project
- Names of the team members
- A description of the project
- The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems
- Semantic versioning, beginning with version 1.0.0 and incremented as changes are made
- A list of any libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function. If needed, provide instructions that the user may need to follow in order to get your application up and running on their own computer.

## Most important guidliness

- Populate your project with issues. Each issue should be a small item, typically linked to a feature task. As you work on an issue, assign it to yourself and move it into the "In progress" column. This will provide an easy way for everyone on the team to see the progress of each issue and know who is working on a particular issue.
- When using GitHub issues, there is the added benefit of being able to close an issue through a commit message or a comment on a pull request (PR). For example, a commit message or comment can say "Closes #42" and the issue will automatically be closed when the pull request is merged. 
- Within your code, document with meaningful comments. For example, a comment might provide an overview of what the function beneath it is doing, or describe the relationship between two variables.
- Follow the code style you have learned throughout this course. Ensure that the team is using meaningful and descriptive names for all files, variables, function names, etc. Follow best practices with casing, spacing, and indentation.
- Your team should decide on standard naming conventions to use throughout the project and hold each other accountable to these standards.
- At the start of your day, it is helpful to have a meeting between the team members to make sure that everyone knows what is going on with the project and to discuss the plan for the day. It is wise to have additional check-ins at lunch time and at the end of the day. With every check-in, assess the current percentage of MVP and make a prediction for when your team will reach full MVP.
- In your morning check-ins, discuss the features each member plans to work on. Determine if the team member will work individually, as a pair, or if the entire team will work on a single feature together, referred to as "mob programming".

During stand-up, each team member will stand up and take turns discussing three points, 10 mins every day:

> 1. What you personally accomplished yesterday
> 1. What you plan to accomplish today
> 1. Anything that is blocking you from making progress

- If a pull request from a teammate has been merged and you working on a branch but are not ready to push your changes, you can still pull those changes while continuing to work on your feature branch. To do so, add and commit any changes on your local feature branch. Check out your master or development branch and pull the changes. Then, check out your feature branch and run the command `git merge master` if the master branch was pulled and `git merge development` if the development branch was pulled.

- Then, create a pull request from your feature branch to the development branch. Do not merge your own pull request. Have one of your team members review and approve the request.
