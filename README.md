## Our project is a website that provides different services to people traveling inside the Middle-East and who love to taste each country's traditional and most famous dishes. 

Our website is created for people who want to try to live a lifestyle as close as possible to that country's people in terms of the food they eat. We collected famous traditional dishes from the most famous kitchens of the Middle East; Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Turkey. You can surf throughout the website looking for these dishes and educate yourself more about the food nature and discover the cultures behind each kind of food. Also, in case you are hungry, we provided here some partner restaurants from everywhere. They are always near to you in the country you stay in. You can order your meal through our website with a good discount. However, if you are an indoor persona that loves to cook the food yourself, we have fabulous recipes with which you can prepare every one of the dishes in your home, adding your unique touches and style. We kindly ask you to contribute to our community by suggesting new dishes if you know one and not seeing them on our website, so please feel free to be part of our valley group. There is a special page where you can fill in the information to that dish, and we will add it to its respective country page as soon as possible. Finally, you can send us your opinion of the website and your suggestion or any other note on our contact us page or our social media channels. See our team on the about us page, and stay in touch!
